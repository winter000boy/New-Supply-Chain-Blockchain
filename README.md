## üìñ Overview

This project is a **Blockchain-based Pharma Supply Chain Management System** that leverages smart contracts to ensure transparency, security, and efficiency in the supply chain. It tracks the journey of pharmaceutical products from raw material suppliers to retailers, ensuring accountability and trust.

---

## üöÄ Features

- **Role Management**: Assign roles like Raw Material Supplier, Manufacturer, Distributor, and Retailer.
- **Medicine Tracking**: Track the history and current status of medicines in the supply chain.
- **Blockchain Transparency**: Ensure secure and immutable records using Ethereum blockchain.
- **Smart Contracts**: Manage supply chain operations with Solidity-based smart contracts.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: React-based frontend for seamless interaction with the blockchain.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Architecture

- **Frontend**: Built with React.js for a responsive and user-friendly interface.
- **Backend**: Smart contracts written in Solidity and deployed using Truffle.
- **Blockchain**: Uses Ganache for local blockchain development and testing.
- **Web3.js**: Facilitates interaction between the frontend and the Ethereum blockchain.

## üìÇ Project Structure

### Step1.
## Installation and Setup

* **VSCODE** : VSCode can be downloaded from https://code.visualstudio.com/
* **Node.js** : Download the latest version of Node.js from https://nodejs.org/ and after installation check     Version using terimal: node -v .
* **Git** : Download the latest version of Git from the official website at https://git-scm.com/downloads and   check Version using terimal: git --version.

* **Ganache** : Download the latest version of Ganache from the official website at https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache.
* **MetaMask** : can be installed as a browser extension from the Chrome Web Store or Firefox Add-ons store.
  
### Step2.
## Create,Compile & Deploy Smart Contract. 

* Open VScode and open VScode Terimal by Ctrl + ' .
* **Clone Project** Type the following command and press Enter : git clone : ` https://github.com/faizack619/Supply-Chain-Blockchain.git  
* **Install truffle** : Type the following command and press Enter: `npm install -g truffle`
* **Install dependencies** : Type the following command and press Enter: `npm i`
* **File structure for  DApp** : 
  
    **contracts**: This folder contains the Solidity smart contracts for the DApp. The Migrations.sol contract is automatically created by Truffle and is used for managing migrations.

    **migrations**: This folder contains the JavaScript migration files used to deploy the smart contracts to the blockchain network.

    **test**: This folder contains the JavaScript test files used to test the smart contracts.

    **truffle-config.js**: This file contains the configuration for the Truffle project, including the blockchain network to be used and any necessary settings.

    **package.jso**n: This file contains information about the dependencies and scripts used in the project.

    **package-lock.json**: This file is generated automatically and contains the exact version of each dependency used in the project.

    **Client**s: This Folder contains the client-side code, typically HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, can be organized into a client folder.
* **Compile the smart contract** :  In the terminal, use the following command to compile the smart contract: `truffle compile` 
* **Deploy the smart contract** :
   
    * After Compile We Need To Deploy Your Smart Contract on Blockchain. In Our Case We are Using Ganache Which is personal blockchain for Ethereum development, used to test and develop Smart Contracts.

    * Open Ganache and create new WorkSpace.Copy Rpc Server Address.

    * ![https://miro.medium.com/max/1248/1*4rzNT0muOXelP22Ky9178g.png](https://miro.medium.com/max/1248/1*4rzNT0muOXelP22Ky9178g.png)

    * The RPC server is used to allow applications to communicate with the Ethereum blockchain and execute smart contract transactions, query the state of the blockchain, and interact with the Ethereum network.

    * Now to add Rcp address in our truffle-config.js and the replace host address and port address with Our Ganache Rcp.

    * ![https://developers.rsk.co/assets/img/tutorials/truffle-test/image-04.png](https://developers.rsk.co/assets/img/tutorials/truffle-test/image-04.png)
  
    * After Changing RCP address.Open terminal and run this cmd : `truffle migrate`.
    * This Command Will deploye Smart Contract to Blockchain.

### Step 3.
## Run DAPP. 
* Open a second terminal and enter the client folder
  * `cd client`
 
* Install all packages in the package.json file
  * `npm i`
  
* Install Web3 in the package.json file
  * `npm install -save web3`


* Run this Command :
  * `npm`
 
* Run the app 
  * `npm start`

* The app gets hosted by default at port 3000.

### Step 4.
## Connect Meta Musk with Ganache.
